# Robust-Explainability
**Aim:** 

Measuring how stable are feature-level explanations are towards external noises

## Schedule
Had all the datasets for feature based models from reading other papers. (Sentires based papers) <br />
**Feb 1 - Feb 3:** Idea Thinking; Professor advised I change from robust fairness to robust explainability <br />
**Feb 5 - Feb 20:** Modifying and Changing code to add adversarial and random noises for all the 3 models <br />
Coding all the 3 models by adding noises <br />
**Feb 21 - Feb 22:** Running base CER + Electronics <br />
**Feb 18 - Feb 26:** Running A2CF + Electronics <br />
**Feb 28 - Mar 2:** Running EFM + Electronics <br />
**Mar 6 - Mar 13:** Tried MTER + Reading for identifying the motivation for robust explanations <br />
**Mar 15 - Mar 25:** Running A2CF + Yelp <br />
**Mar 20 - Apr 2:** Running EFM + Yelp <br />
**Mar 26 - Mar 28:** Running CER base + Yelp <br />
**Mar 29 - Apr 5:** Running CER Expl + Yelp <br />
**Apr 5 - Apr 7:** Running CER Expl + Electronics (all users used for these runs unlike the trial one for sir on Feb 10) <br />
