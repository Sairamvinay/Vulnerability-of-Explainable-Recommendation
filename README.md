# Robust-Explainability
**Aim:** 

Measuring how stable are feature-level explanations are towards external noises

# Datasets
- Yelp 2019
- Amazon Electronics

# Models considered
- [CER](https://github.com/chrisjtan/counter)
- [A2CF](https://bitbucket.org/rockytchen/a2cf-sigir20/src/master/)
- [EFM](https://github.com/wubinzzu/Explainable-Recommendation)
- [MTER](https://github.com/MyTHWN/MTER)


# Schedule

## Problem Formulation
Had all the datasets for feature based models from reading other papers. (Sentires based papers) <br />
**Feb 1 - Feb 3:** Idea Thinking; Professor advised I change from robust fairness to robust explainability ; I easily chose feature based explainability for easy measuring and model based attacks for faster analyses. I had identified a problem setting and problem broadly. <br />
## Problem Verification on small test dataset
**Feb 3 - Feb 10:** Tried testing 2 simple models and checked how well they model with increasing noise levels within a week
## Coding
**Feb 5 - Feb 20:** Modifying and Changing code to add adversarial and random noises for all the 3 models: Coding all the 3 models by adding noises <br /> <br />
## Experiment Runs
**Feb 21 - Feb 22:** Running base CER + Electronics <br />
**Feb 18 - Feb 26:** Running A2CF + Electronics <br />
**Feb 28 - Mar 2:** Running EFM + Electronics <br />
**Mar 6 - Mar 13:** Tried MTER + Reading for identifying the motivation for robust explanations <br />
**Mar 15 - Mar 25:** Running A2CF + Yelp <br />
**Mar 20 - Apr 2:** Running EFM + Yelp <br />
**Mar 26 - Mar 28:** Running CER base + Yelp <br />
**Mar 29 - Apr 5:** Running CER Expl + Yelp <br />
**Apr 5 - Apr 7:** Running CER Expl + Electronics (all users used for these runs unlike the trial one for sir on Feb 10) <br />
## Reporting

**Mar 26 - Apr 8:** Writing first draft
